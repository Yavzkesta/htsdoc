# How to Modify Your MOTD via server.properties

:::tip Tip

The Minecraft MOTD is a message that appears in the server list when players connect.

:::

To modify the MOTD via the `server.properties` file, follow these steps:

1. Open the `server.properties` file with a text editor.

2. Look for the line starting with `motd=`.

3. Modify this line to reflect your new MOTD. For example, if your MOTD is "Welcome to our server!", you would change the line to `motd=Welcome to our server!`.

4. Save the changes made to the file and close it.

5. Restart your Minecraft server.

Now, when players connect to your server, the new MOTD will appear in the welcome area.
