# How to Add a Plugin to Your Minecraft Server?

:::danger Warning

You must have a server compatible with plugins (for example, Spigot, Paper, Mohist...).

:::

To add a plugin to your Minecraft server, follow these steps:

1. Access your server's SFTP (all details are available in the SFTP Details on your panel).

2. Place your plugin file into the `Plugins` folder.

3. Restart your server.

Once you have completed these steps, verify if the plugin has loaded correctly. To do this, execute the `plugins` command in the console. If the plugin is listed in green, it has loaded successfully. If it is red, there was an issue loading the plugin, and you will need to check the console for any messages from the plugin indicating why it did not load.
