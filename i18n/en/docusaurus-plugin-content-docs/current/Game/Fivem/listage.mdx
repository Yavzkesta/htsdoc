# How to List Your FiveM Server

To list your FiveM server, specific configurations need to be made in the `server.cfg` file. Follow these steps to ensure that your server is correctly listed and accessible.

## Basic Configuration

Start by opening your `server.cfg` file and add or verify the following lines:
```cfg
sv_endpointPrivacy true
# This option ensures that some information about your server remains private.
```

:::tip Using a Subdomain IP
The server's IP can be a subdomain, like `Gamex.hebergtonserv.com:theport`.
:::

## Advanced Configuration

After configuring the endpoint privacy, continue with the advanced settings:
```cfg
set sv_useDirectListing true # Enables FiveM listing view
set sv_listingIPOverride "gamex.hebergtonserv.com:yourport"  # Should match your sv_endpoints
sets sv_projectName "[FR]^1 LSDream FA:nazar_amulet:ãƒ»^7discord.gg/^147ACRnWSd3" # Name of your project
sets sv_projectDesc "Old Jersey " # Description of your project
set onesync on # 'on' for infinity (+64 slots) / 'legacy' for (-64 slots) # Enables OneSync
set steam_webApiKey none # Steam API Key (replace 'none' with your key if necessary)
set sv_licenseKey YOUR_KEY # FiveM License Key
sv_maxclients 64 # Maximum number of clients on your FiveM server
```

## Validating Changes

Once these configurations are added and modified, save the `server.cfg` file. Then, restart your FiveM server for the changes to take effect.

Check that your server appears correctly in the FiveM server list and is accessible to players.

By following these instructions, your FiveM server should be correctly listed and configured to offer an optimal experience for players.
